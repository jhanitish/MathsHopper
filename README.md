## Nodejs

If you don't have Node js in your machine then this will be a quick guide to get up to speed.

Go to the website
``` 
nodejs.org/en/downloads 

```

After installing the installer and node js,

For windows users 
The defult installation path will be something like "C:\Program Files\nodejs".

On Unix/Linux:
You can add the following lines to your shell configuration file (e.g., .bashrc, .bash_profile, .zshrc):.
```
export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/nodejs/bin
```

Step 3;

Setup the proper path for the system
```
$env:Path = [System.Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable('Path','Machine')
node -v
npm -v
```

Then try the above commands again.
If everything was done right then the command will show the version of nodejs installed.


If the version is displayed then congratulations nodejs has been successfully then you can continue from Step 2 onwards. 



Happy Hopping!!!!
